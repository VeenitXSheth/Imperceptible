# Imperceptible
Search Engine Project With Vanilla JS.  

This was a project my friend and I worked on during 2022. It is a basic search engine using vanilla JS that is built in the browser.
Link: https://search.imperceptible.repl.co

It uses Jaroâ€“Winkler Distance to figure out if search terms are related and features accounts and login systems through Replit's Authentication API. 
We plan to expand this project into a viable search engine in the future with a proper database structure. 

Thanks for reading, make sure to read the docs.html page to see how to use and to suggest new search terms!
